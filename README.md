# PunnettMev2
PunnettMe v2 replicates the same process as a Punnett Square
for comparing the genes of two reproducing partners and their offspring. 
Includes the percent-chance of each offspring combination in the data
results.

Changes from PunnettMe v1:

Started development with User Stories.
Designed a UML diagram.
Created Gene class hierarchy using the Decorator Design Pattern.
Increased the amount of genes between two partners to 10, up from 5.
Created a brand new GUI using JavaFX instead of AWT/Swing.
Created an Executable jar file*. 
Used good programming principles such as "programming to an interface, 
not an implementation" when appropriate.

***The Executable jar file requires JDK 10.0.2 or higher to function***
